#README

this is where I do my small experiments with the things I want to learn in Scala.

Index:
- CatsIO: functional IO monad
- Circe: JSON library
- Monocle: Functional lenses
- Refined: Refining data types 
- Scalacheck: testing libraru
- Scalaz IOEffect: another IO library. This is on an ongoing work
- StateMachineWithTypes: creating a state machine with Data Types. 
- TypeClasses: adding functionality to existing classes. Includes polymorphism 


Things to learn at some point: 

- Free monads VS Tagless final
- Finish the Scalaz IO
