this is where I do my small experiments with the things I want to learn in Scala. 

Index:
1. CatsIO: functional IO monad
2. Circe: JSON library
3. Monocle: Functional lenses
4. Refined: Refining data types 
5. Scalacheck: testing libraru
6. Scalaz IOEffect: another IO library. This is on an ongoing work
7. StateMachineWithTypes: creating a state machine with Data Types. 
8. TypeClasses: adding functionality to existing classes. Includes polymorphism 


Things to learn at some point: 

- Free monads VS Tagless final
- Finish the Scalaz IO
- Testing on Monocle: how to demonstrate isomorphism on transformations?
- ChainOfResponsibility: version 2, separation of concerns
